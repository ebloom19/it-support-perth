By integrating with your LinkedIn profile, Acedit can:

- **Analyze your career path** to match interview questions with relevant experience.
- **Extract key skills** and achievements to incorporate into your responses.
- **Understand your industry** and provide answers that align with your role.

This level of context ensures that every suggestion or response generated by Acedit is **highly relevant** and **personalized** to your background.

## üéØ How It Works

Here‚Äôs how Acedit uses LinkedIn data to improve your interview preparation:

### 1. Profile Analysis
Once you link your LinkedIn profile to Acedit, the tool begins analyzing various aspects of your career. This includes:

- **Job titles and work history** to identify relevant industry terms and experiences.
- **Skills and endorsements** to highlight key areas of expertise.
- **Professional recommendations** to emphasize strengths and capabilities.

Acedit then tailors your interview responses based on the **specific role** you're applying for, ensuring that your answers showcase the most **relevant experiences**.

### 2. Contextual Responses
One of the standout features of Acedit is its ability to generate **context-rich responses**. By pulling details from your LinkedIn profile, Acedit can generate responses that:
