## Essential Outfit Details for Virtual Interviews

### Choosing the Right Top: Colors and Styles That Work on Camera

Your upper body garments deserve special attention as they occupy 75% of the video frame. Research by the Color Psychology Institute shows that certain colors perform better on camera.

[A Specific color conveys a specific message and impression to the interviewer](https://www.fastcompany.com/3036012/why-you-should-never-wear-orange-to-an-interview). Solid and Neutral Colors like Black, White, Gray, Navy Blue, or Brown, look great on camera and provide a clean, professional appearance. These neutral outfits avoid the risk of clashing with your background or being too harsh on the screen.

Avoid bright colors like yellow, red, purple, and sharp blue. These colors appear too intense and may create a distraction during the interview. Also, neon shades, noisy patterns, or prints appear disturbing or busy on the camera. It is always a good idea to avoid these.

### The Importance of Fit: Avoiding Distracting Clothing

Choosing the perfect outfit for your online interview is a real bother. While you try to fit in the job requirements, you must also watch if your dress fits too.

Your outfit should be comfortable—not too tight, which can appear uncomfortable, and not too loose, which keeps shifting and requires constant adjustment.

Moreover, you must ensure your clothes are ironed and wrinkle-free.

Choose an outfit that makes you feel comfortable and confident.

## Complete Your Look with the Accessories

Wearing accessories enhances your look but make sure they are not heavy and shiny as it create a distraction on the camera. 

Feel free to wear minimal and subtle pieces like a nice simple classic watch, small hoops, or earrings, a small pendant, or glasses with a stylish professional frame that can add a polished look.

---

## Setting the Scene: The Importance of Background and Lighting

Make sure you check your background and the surroundings before accepting that interview call. Before the call, take time and open your camera then see for yourself, and clear this checklist:

* Is the camera quality good enough?
* Is the light good? 
* Are there any irrelevant objects seen inside the frame?
* Is the background clean and simple?

YES to all of these questions makes sure your surrounding is cooperative and the scene is perfect for your online interview.

## Common Dressing Mistakes to Avoid

Candidates preparing for their virtual interview must understand the balance between comfort and professionalism. While having very little to choose from, there are still some common mistakes that need to be avoided.

You might be required to gather resources away from your desk and when you stand up, you're seen in pajamas. What mark does that leave on the interviewer? Make sure you dress identically to what you'd wear if attending an in-person interview.

Distractive patterned outfits, heavy makeup, and jewelry are red flags. Moreover, be certain not to wear a sporty outfit. These put a bad impression on an interviewer and reflect your negligence and disrespect for the interview.

## Outfits That Can Be Distracting or Unprofessional

### Understanding the Risks of Casual Attire

While attending an online interview, it is crucial to understand how certain outfits can be distracting and unprofessional.

Casual attire, such as sweatpants, or graphic tees, is comfortable but can mirror your professional image. While being somewhere okay can become tempting for the interviewer.

It is always the best way to get attached to the business casuals if you're not sure what to wear in an online interview.

## Last-Minute Outfit Checks Before Your Online Interview

The online interview is scheduled for tomorrow and you are going through your checklist. Here's what to check one day before your interview:

* The outfit is professional and minimal. It aligns with your job role and industry standards.
* The dress is ironed and clean. No wrinkles or dark patches on the dress.
* The outfit is not super shiny and bright that it distracts the interviewer more towards your dress rather than your face.

### Practicing Your Look: How to Test Your Appearance on Camera

Before you appear in your interview, test your appearance first. Stand in front of the mirror to check if there is anything wrong with the outfit. When the outfit is good, sit at the place where you will be attending the interview.

Now, open your camera and see if your face is clear and at least your lower chest fits in the frame. This is the easiest way to scan for any faults before the interview.

You know everything is perfect after you follow our guide to wearing an outfit for an online interview.
