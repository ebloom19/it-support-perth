## 1. Tell me about yourself

This open-ended question is often used as an icebreaker. Keep your answer professional and relevant to the job you're applying for.
Focus on your professional background, skills, and experiences that make you a great fit for the role.

Employers want to know that you're genuinely interested in their company and the position.
Research the company beforehand and highlight specific aspects of their mission or culture that resonate with you.

## 3. What are your greatest strengths?

Choose strengths that are relevant to the job and back them up with specific examples.

Be honest, but choose a weakness that you're actively working to improve.
After mentioning your weakness, explain the steps you're taking to overcome it.

## 5. Where do you see yourself in five years?

This question assesses your career goals and ambition. Align your answer with the potential growth opportunities at the company.

## 6. Can you describe a challenging work situation and how you overcame it?

Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure your response.

## 7. Why should we hire you?

Highlight your unique skills and experiences that make you the best candidate for the role.

## 8. What are your salary expectations?

Research industry standards and be prepared to provide a range rather than a specific number.

## 9. Do you have any questions for us?

Always have a few thoughtful questions prepared to show your interest in the role and company.
Ask about the company culture, team dynamics, or opportunities for professional development.

## 10. Why did you leave your last job?

Be honest but positive. Focus on what you learned and how you're looking to grow in your career.
Remember, practice makes perfect! Rehearse your answers to these common questions, but be sure to keep your responses natural and conversational during the actual interview.
