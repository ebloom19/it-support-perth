## Why Malicious Links Are Dangerous

According to recent data from <a href="https://www.ibm.com/security/data-breach" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IBM's Security Report</a>, 75% of phishing attacks involve links that appear trustworthy. Cybercriminals use these deceptive links to:

- Steal login credentials
- Install malware or ransomware
- Redirect users to convincing fake websites
- Compromise business data

## How to Check if a Link is Secure üîí

<br />

### 1. Hover Over the Link
- Place your mouse pointer over the link (don't click!)
- Check if the preview URL matches the claimed destination
- Watch for slight variations (e.g., yourb4nk.com vs. yourbank.com)

<br />

### 2. Look for HTTPS
- Secure websites start with `https://`
- Avoid links starting with `http://`
- Check for the padlock icon in your browser

<br />

### 3. Check for Subdomain Tricks
- Look for deceptive domains like `paypal-secure-login.com`
- Legitimate sites use their main domain (e.g., `paypal.com`)
- Be wary of hyphens or numbers in domain names

<br />

### 4. Use Link Scanning Tools
- Utilize <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VirusTotal</a> for URL scanning
