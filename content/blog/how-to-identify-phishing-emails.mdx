## What is Phishing?

Phishing is a sophisticated form of cyberattack where criminals attempt to trick recipients into revealing sensitive information such as passwords, credit card details, or company data. According to recent data from <a href="https://www.ibm.com/security/data-breach" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IBM's Security Report</a>, 90% of data breaches begin with phishing attacks, making it a critical security concern for businesses of all sizes.

## Key Signs of a Phishing Email üö©

<br />

### 1. Suspicious Sender Addresses
- Legitimate organizations use professional email domains (e.g., support@yourbank.com)
- Watch for slight variations like support@yourb4nk.com
- Always verify the sender's full email address, not just the display name

<br />

### 2. Generic or Impersonal Greetings
- Be wary of "Dear Sir/Madam" or "Dear Customer"
- Legitimate businesses typically use your actual name
- Generic greetings often indicate mass-sent phishing attempts

<br />

### 3. Urgent or Threatening Language
Common pressure tactics include:
- "Your account will be suspended immediately"
- "Final warning before legal action"
- "Limited time offer - Act now!"

<br />

### 4. Grammar and Spelling Errors
- Professional organizations proofread their communications
- Multiple typos or awkward phrasing suggest potential fraud
- Poor formatting or inconsistent branding are red flags

<br />

### 5. Suspicious Attachments or Links
- Hover over links to preview URLs before clicking
- Be cautious of unexpected attachments
- Watch for slight misspellings in domain names
