## What is Layered Security?

Layered security, also known as "defense in depth," involves implementing multiple security measures across your IT systems. Each layer acts as a barrier, ensuring that if one defense is breached, others remain to protect your data and network.

According to <a href="https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/publications/essential-eight-maturity-model" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Australian Cyber Security Centre</a>, organizations should implement multiple layers of security controls to effectively protect against cyber threats.
